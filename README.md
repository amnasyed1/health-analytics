This HHA 506 assignment is a primer for HHA 504/507 classes that will be taken in the fall. 


## The Variables I used
for the number varibale i created the patient's age, which is 22

for the string variable i created the patient's name, which is Taylor

for the list varibale i created health conditions of the patient  = [migranes, asthma, allergies] 

for the dictionary i created the patient's health record including the patient name, age, health conditions, and current medications

## Explaination of the Function
The function measures the oxygen saturation level of a patient dependent on the 2 inputs: if the individual has asthma and their average oxygen level. If the individual has asthma and their oxygen level is inputted as a number below a 95, the output of the function will be to "put on a oxygen respirator". If the individual has asthma and the input of the o2 level is 95, the output of the function will be to "keep an observation on the o2 level", and if the individual has asthma and the input is anything else other than the other conditions listed the output will be "no need for oxygen respirator". 

## Expected Output Based on Example Data
The expected output based on the example data is no need for oxygen respirator, since Taylor's oxygen level is at 98.
